# Reviews

Here, I review the albums I listen to.

## How I review

In the past I have noticed that critiques from the media impact my attitude
toward the songs I hear.
While that is not necessarily a bad thing, I think it's also interesting to
review music outside of its contemporary context - to focus on how I honestly
feel about the music upon first contact.

In order to achieve this, I randomly choose the albums to review.
I use the [Spotify Random Song
Generator](http://www.karnhuset.net/demos/spotify/randomSong/) to come across
an album whose reputation I know nothing of (bonus points if I don't know the
artist).
Then I resist the urge to look up reviews on the album.

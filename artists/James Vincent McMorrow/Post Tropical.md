# James Vincent McMorrow - Post Tropical

## Overall

80/100

A solid set of songs marked by impressive falsettos and liberal song structures.
The artist seems to have explored extensively what set of instruments would best
accompany his talented singing skills.
A soothing, comforting listen with ambitious attempts observed here and there.

## Tracks

### Cavalier

Organs set up a good atmosphere for the singer's impressive falsetto.
The organs switch to a more ambitious brass-y tone as the drums kick in, as the
falsetto keeps reminiscing about "my first love".
Just as I thought the song was ending, it leaves about a minute of somewhat
bittersweet quietness.

### The Lakes

Wow this guy is so high-pitched.
The song starts off with a familiar texture that reminds me of a fairy tale.
Then it switches to an unexpected chord sequence in the second half-ish.
Nice.
The organ-like sounding guitar throughout the chorus is great.

### Red Dust

Nice bass-y kick drums, they go along with the repeating background vocals.
The song ends with a nice texture probably involving some synths.
A pretty ordinary track.
Nice fadeout of the bass.

### Gold

A nice track.
Nice harp-y texture.
The singing in the chorus is really impressive - it is an interesting,
fast-paced progression notes, delivered through impressive falsettos.
The trumpet-y synth (?) is put to good use throughout the song, especially the
solo.
I'm starting to find the structures of the songs in this album quite liberal
and refreshing.
So far they don't necessarily follow the conventional pattern of verse-chorus -
instead they seem to let the singer's stream of words just flow into
culmination.

### All Points

The beginning of this song puts me through imagining how this song would have
sounded had it been done by other artists.
What if Radiohead produced it in *In Rainbows*?
What if in *OK Computer*?
These thoughts make me conclude JVM manages to paint unique colors to simple
textures, especially in terms of how powerful his singing is.
Once again, an interesting progression of notes in the chorus (or whatever, his
songs seem to be quite liberal in structure).
Then, in the bridge (or whatever), the complete set of drums kick in, as the
falsettos in the background culminate.
Then, the song suddenly ends into quietness, where only the percussions and some
synth notes (?) remain.
I'm enjoying the liberal structures of the songs.

### Look Out

As the synths kick in around the halfway mark, the song elevates to an ambitious
status.
Nice use of higher frequencies in the background during this ambitious phase.
The highlight, though, is when the song abandons this ambitious part and
switches to a reverb-y guitar tone - by now it has become clear that the artist
is not obsessed with reusing song parts, but is rather interested in just
expressing a stream of thoughts.

### Repeating

(once again) A nice harp-y texture - probably using steel guitars?
Nice surprise bursts followed by a good buildup of drums.
The repeating (no pun intended) harp-y sound at the end of the track adds the
right amount of trance to the atmosphere.
Overall, the track builds up carefully until the very end, where things fade out
into a pretty reverb.

### Post Tropical

**Best track of the album.**
I guess this is the title track?
This time, a texture made of pianos.
Kind of reminds me of Arcade Fire's *We Used To Wait*.
Cool cowbells.
In the chorus part, there is this nice trumpet-y bass that is side-chained - I
like it.
Then, of course, the song changes into something new around the 4:00 mark,
accompanied with a guitar riff with little reverb.
Though these liberal structures are proving very effective, I at the same time
find them a bit too repetitive across the album.

### Glacier

A nice piano track that is, of course, no longer a piano track after a certain
point.
The song structure is quite similar to Post Tropical.
Nice chorus vocals in the second half.
There are lots of interesting dynamic uses of instruments throughout the first
half of the song.

### Outside, Digging

A nice, comforting last track with some of the most magmatic vocals across the
album boiling underneath.

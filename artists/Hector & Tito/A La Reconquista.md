# Hector & Tito - A La Reconquista

## Overall

76/100

A neatly engineered album, marked by impressively powerful rap-singing across
all tracks.

## Tracks

### Yo Te Buscaba

The intro/chorus is overwhelmingly unique.
It uses a progression of notes that I am not familiar with and feels very fresh.
Moreover, the singer (not sure if male or female) does a great job blending the
powerful vocal tone into the background notes.

The verses are mediocre.

### Gata Salvaje

The singer continues to deliver an overwhelmingly good atmosphere over the
music.
This song also maintains more consistency between the intro/chorus and the
verses - the strength is never lost throughout the track, whereas in the first
track the verses were much more underwhelming than the chorus.

The same sort of crude snares from the first track continue to be in use.

### Besos En La Boca

The singer continues to surprise me with the unique set of notes.
The track is pretty similar to the previous too, so not much to say, though I
must say I liked the gun sounds interlude.

### Felina

Man, this singer is awesome even under autotune.
Just a really impressive singer.
If I ever make a track myself that needs to sound super powerful, I'll need this
person.

I find the use of the rolling strings in the background quite creative.
Other than that, this track is once again way too similar to all of the previous
ones.
Actually, I think the chorus sounds very similar to that of Yo Te Buscaba.

### Despues Que Cae La Lluvia

This track adds some diversity to the album!
The guitar-led background sounds comfortable, over which the rapper starts to
sing!
At a peak, the rapper's voice gets so loud and powerful that it matches the
singer's.
Loving the verse-sharing between the two.
I really enjoy how the chorus ends up so strong in the last 10 seconds.
Solid track.
Contender for best track, but I gave the title to En Una Disco.

### Noche De Loba

Ah, that crude snare is back.
How about a little more exprimentation with drums?
Anyway, this track has some interesting aspects too.
I like the icy synths in the background work pretty well in terms of providing
an ambitious and cold atmosphere.
Also, the boundary between rapping and singing collapses further, as the rapper
continues to sing and the singer raps.

### Caserio

The first 20 seconds is a good coordination of various sounds.
Good combination of steel strings and cello (or whatever) strings.
Both Hector and Tito demonstrate a pretty good rapping flow in this track.
I especially enjoy how they strategically some rhymes around the ending snares
in the fourth measure.

### Tigresa

Nothing really new in this track.
The song suddenly slows down at one point, but they make pretty uninteresting
use of this effect.
I can see how this song can appeal to the crowd at shows, though, especially at
the end where things get cheer-y.

### Duele

This track sounds pretty new until those same old snares kick in, lol.

Wanted to point out something I noticed about this great singer.
I think her mid, 1000Hz or whatever frequency range really has an important
place in the singing.
The recording of the singing sounds like it has a rough edge thanks to that
frequency range, and this aspect really makes the singing stand out.

### Sientan El Ran Tan Tan

Is the rap-singing in the beginning from the same rapper?
Super powerful, with an added depth unobserved in previous tracks.
This track carries a lot of raw power, and the repeating string/synth in the
background induces a slight trance effect on me.
I also like how the guns sounds blend in perfectly with the good old snares.
Solid track.

### Flores Pa' Los Muertos

The awesome singer is layered multiple times, leading to an even more powerful
effect.
The beat is quite fresh - it reminds me of some Korean tunes from the 60s or
something.
The singing also utilizes a set of notes that I don't think the singer has
demonstrated in previous tracks - it goes very well with the cool beat.
Also, nice falsetto vocals in the background during the verse.
Solid track.

### Tra Tra

This track is interesting.

- The distorted, repetitive rapping (or word-speaking, whatever)
- The beat consists of some
- Uses a lower-tone snare at certain parts
- This guy with a low voice surprises me at the 1:10 mark, and he is good at it
- Where did the awesome singer go? I think I hear the singer at the 1:30 mark
on the left headphone
- The laughter and the random horny girl at 1:55 blend in seamlessly.

Solid track.

### Bandida Universitaria

The singer is back!
Mediocre track, nothing new when compared to the first few tracks.

### De Nina A Mujer

They did something interesting the synth in the background - I think they split
a normal synth recording into sections and reversed each part or something.
But the escalation of the notes is very smooth and intriguing.
The rap-singing demonstrates a good balance between rapping and singing.
I think there is at least one new singer in this track, and the singings in the
background are decent.

### En Una Disco

**Best track of the album.**

OMG a new snare!!!
lol.
But seriously, this new snare is nice, and this beat is really good.
Combined with the awesome singer's rap-singing, this track is almost
trance-inducing.
They did a stellar job with the bass - it sounds like it's bouncing and flowing
smoothly.
As the track progresses, more instruments get added along the way, producing a
fuller soundscape.
And the fascination continues to the very last second, where some synth delay
effect is in place.
Exciting track.

### Gata Salvaje - Remix

I notice the synths from the original got changed to strings/pianos/something.
Also, the tom toms are new.
I prefer the original for its raw power.

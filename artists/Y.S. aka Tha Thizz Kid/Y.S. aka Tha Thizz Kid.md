# Y.S. aka Tha Thizz Kid - Y.S. aka Tha Thizz Kid

## Overall

68/100

The songwriting quality across the album is uniformly high - which is admirable
in particular given the fact that there are 16 songs.
There is consistency to the beats, and the raps are okay in general while some
featured rappers and singers really show it off.

My problem with the album is that it sounds under-produced and under-mastered.
Or should I say under-engineered?
I notice a lot of murkiness across the album, and there are a few moments of
brilliance that could have bloomed so much further with the help of extra
engineering.

I find some similarities between this album and Kanye West's Yeezus.
At certain parts, they share the boldness in the beats with minimal but crazy
synths and the somewhat carefree nature of the lyrics.
Such innovative attempts come at the cost of requiring a broader control of the
sonic scape, in my opinion.
Whereas Yeezus overcomes this downside with seamless engineering, this album
could have done much more to unleash its full potential.

## Tracks

### Ronald Dregan Skit

I'm not exactly sure what this is about.
Judging by the fact that one of the featured artists is Mac Dre, the track title
is probably a play on Ronald Regan and this artist.
Is the background voice the actual Ronald Regan the president?
Or is it someone else?
I have no idea.
There is some profanity, so maybe not, but who knows.
The voice talks about "stepping it up" in time of war.
I'm also not exactly sure how three artists are featured - all I hear is the
voice and some laughter.
Just a confusing track.

### Set The Roof On Fire

I like the beat!
I wish the bass drum was tighter and more impactful, the hi-hats had less treble
distortion, and the synth in the fourth measure was more spacious.
But in general, I like the atmosphere.

The rap flows across the three verses are all decent.
I think they need to use better mic amps or something to make their voices sound
warmer and fatter, though.
I don't have enough production knowledge to describe this, unfortunately.

I really like the rhymes in the chorus, made me dance for a bit.
Some subtle additional synths that flange between left and right in the
background during the choruses too - nice addition.

Solid track.

### Dumbest To Touch Turf

Nice bass drums, but a very similar synth from the one I pointed out in the
previous track about spaciousness is being used again, and this synth is ruining
the excitement of the bass a little bit.

The chorus is kind of cute honestly.

Mediocre track.

### Let's Ride

Once again, the bass is really good, but some of my wishes from the previous
tracks are repeating.
I wish the kick drum was tighter (has too much mid - sounds like the timpani),
and the string-y like synth occupied more space.
But the general atmosphere of the beat is nice.
I like the distorted synth in the outro is good - wish it was fatter.

Good track.

### Yellow Bus

What sounds like a typical trap track surprises me with the singing rap intro.
Haha, good creativity there.
Nice use of space with that ticking sound in the background.
Also, once again, I think the artist is quite good at controlling the bass - I
notice good chops in the bass.

Good track.

### Yokin'

Similar atmosphere to Set The Roof On Fire from earlier - reminds me of some
middle-eastern tunes?
The middle-eastern-sounding synth is great, very subtle in controlling its
strength.

Good control of the bass, once again.
Really awesome to hear it on its own around the 2:00 mark.

The timpani-like kick drum is back, but it works out in this case.

Good track.

### Yadadayippitty

**Best track of the album.**

Sudden transition from the previous track - almost sounds like they are one same
track.
When the synths become dry into a single central synth around 0:16, the track
reminds me of some tracks in Yeezus, in terms of how a repetitive, distorted
synth sound controls the atmosphere.

The layers of synth in the chorus make interesting use of space - it's inspiring
to enjoy the transition from the dry synth during the verses to the wet,
spacious synths in the chorus.

Solid track.
I see a lot of potential in this track.

### Mo' Donuts

The beat is mediocre - quite similar to Yokin', but less interesting.

Whoever raps in the second verse has a very good flow.
Reminds me of Jay-Z in the track Monster in My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy.
Solid rap skills.

The chorus is powerful, very dance-y.

Good track.

Why do a fadeout when you're going to end the track in echoes?

### Dummy Mummy

Lots of "hey! hello!" in the beginning, lol.

Man, the beat that lasts from 0:35 to 0:45 is **fantastic**.
I wish they it last the whole song.
It creates an awesome, icy, eerie feeling with minimalism - with just some tom
toms and icy synths.
Reminds me of Blood On The Leaves on Yeezus.
Beats like this part are what keeps reminding me of Yeezus.

The rest of the track is mediocre.
The raps aren't that great.
The Indian/middle-eastern theme continues.

### Hear Dat Beat

The distorted synth sounds unfinished.
Mediocre track, nothing new here.
The second verse had good style.
Y.S. himself hasn't rapped any impressive verses so far.

### Yahh Yahh

Ah, see, another track that reminds me of Yeezus.
The beat really reminds me of Send It Up.
The rap is alright.
Mediocre track.

### Hey Gurl

Mediocre track, but the R&B singing around 2:00 is very good, especially how the
bass is so well-tuned to go along with the singing.
Nice work there.

### I Still Got You On My Mind

This track is quite an atmosphere changer.
Sweet, and the artist's good sense of bass really shines in this track.
Man, that bass-y instrument in the chorus - so good.
The female vocals are nice, and well layered with proper delays.
Oh, and my request for a tight bass finally gets fulfilled here.

Solid track.
I considered track for the best track of the album, but I gave the title to
another track for the uniqueness in that other track.

### DoDaDO

The singing in the chorus is good, and the bass is tuned correctly to support
it.
This album has such a good control of the bass that the artist should focus on
other parts of production from here on.
The verse at 2:00 has good style.

Good track.

### Speak Thizzlamic

I don't like the space-y synth during the verses - I think it's too spaced out.
Good job not making it stand too out during the rapping, though.
The raps are so-so.

Mediocre track.

### My Crib

The beat is interesting with its use of the chorus-ed/wah-ed guitar.
J.J.'s singing shines again.

Mediocre track.

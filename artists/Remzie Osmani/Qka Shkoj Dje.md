# Remzie Osmani - Qka Shkoj Dje

## Overall

**Disclaimer:** I do not know what language this album is in.
I do not know what country this album is from.
I do not understand any of the lyrics.
But that doesn't stop me from listening to and evaluating this album.
When I hear songs in English, I very often don't understand the words.
In my opinion, the language is only a small part of enjoying music.
Despite the language barrier, I was able to extract a lot of inspiration and
positivity from this album - I am happy with the experience.

75/100

The overall tone of the album feels quite familiar to me, despite the language
barrier and the genre that is supposed to be exotic to me (not that I have any
idea what genre to call this).
I think it has some features in common with some Korean pop tunes in particular.

There is a lot of inspiration to draw from the album.
I found quite a few moments of brilliance.
In particular, the solo instruments seem to be played in a masterful manner, and
often hit note progressions I'm not familiar with.

Another thing to note is the good combination of dance-y tunes and more pensive
tracks.
The overall dynamic across the album is solid, making it an enjoyable listen.

## Ah Moj Grue

Awesome funky intro/chorus!
The verses are pretty plain.
Nice subtle secondary vocals underneath the female vocals.
There's a cool bridge that combines the electric guitar with the other string
instrument.
Solid album opener, would have been a lot better if the verses were a little
more dynamic.

## Qka Shkoj Dje Nuk Kthehet Sot

** Best track of the album.**

Unimpressive first part, except the wah-wah bass and synths over the chorus.
The song becomes much more interesting when the female vocals kick in - the note
progression is quite inspiring.
In particular, the synth or whatever brass-y instrument that plays the solo is
really impressive.
This is a progression of notes I'm not familiar with - it sounds so creative.
The outro solo is similarly sweet.
**Sick** solos.

## Mihane

Familiar chord progression (reminds me of Korean pop songs).
The female vocals add a good dimension to the song.
I find her singing pretty sweet.
The solo at the end seems to create an inspiring atmosphere by hitting some flat
notes.
Overall, an unimpressive track.

## Sa Ishim Pa Martu

The beginning solo (which repeats throughout the track) is quite impressive.
The rest of the song is unimpressive.

## Kojshike

This track reminds me of drum n bass!
Once again, cool solo, but pretty unimpressive track.

## Fjala E Urte Popullore

Nice dance-y pop tune!
A comfortable mix of synths across the track.
This is the kind of familiarity that I would not label as unimpressive.

## Asnjehere

Another comfortable dance tune, though this time with more minor chords.
The synth/whatever solo is rather unimpressive.

## Te Dua

This song made solid attempts to turn a banal song structure into a dynamically
evolving set of segments.
The song changes its tone at least several times throughout the track.
Such attempts culminate in the last minute where the solo lands calmly back into
the vocals.

# Epilogue

Ugh, I can't wait to look up who this artist is and what country she is from!
A fun album.
